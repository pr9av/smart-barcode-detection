# 📦 OpenCV Barcode Detection System

A computer vision-based barcode detection system built using **Python** and **OpenCV** that can accurately detect and decode multiple barcode formats from images.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of image processing techniques for real-world scanning applications such as retail billing systems, inventory management, and logistics tracking.
